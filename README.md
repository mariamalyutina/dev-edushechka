Develop a backend for college that aims to structure interactions between teachers, students and managers.
The system should provide the ability to track attendance, homework and student payment for the course.
In addition, students in the system should be united into groups and be able to receive feedback on completed work.

All users of the system are divided into 6 roles: Administrator, Student, College Manager, Methodist, Teacher, Tutor. 
One user can have several roles.
